**The [Trello](https://trello.com/) project management platform was used to manage the application's implementation plan and design. I was successful at planning, prioritising, and organising my activities into digestible portions.**

### **An _Agile_ based sprint board can be created as depicted below :**

- ### **Backlog**

  - **Includes the tasks that must be completed for a project**

- ### **In Development**

  - **Includes tasks that must be completed or are being worked on.**

- ### **Ready For Test**

  - **Includes tasks that are completed and are in the testing phase**

- ### **Product Walkthrough**

  - **Includes tasks for a senior team-member to review before presenting it to the client for feedback**

- ### **Ready For Release**

  - **Includes tasks/features ready for client feedback**

- ### **Done**

  - **Includes all completed tasks**

However, we did not include the _`Product Walkthrough`_ list in the board. In addition, each task was color-coded according to priority, with red representing high priority, orange representing medium priority, and yellow representing low priority. In addition, for each activity, a checklist of checklist items was provided, which aided in breaking down the tasks into smaller components. Finally, each job was assigned a serial number, which made it much easier to make frequent commits to a remote repository.

The color-coded scheme is depicted below.

## **Managing and Tracking Tasks: How We Succeeded**

- Using labels and color coding to categorise tasks

- Utilising a checklist for each item or task

- Setting up due dates to track the progress of each task

- Reviewing and updating the board regularly

- Writing and participating in stand ups with our peers and educators on Discord
